# Installation

## Official Releases

Official releases will be made to [sylikc's GitHub Releases](https://github.com/sylikc/jpegview/releases) page.  Each release includes:
* **Archive Zip/7z** - Portable
* **Windows Installer MSI** - For Installs
* **Source code** - Build it yourself

## Portable

JPEGView _does not require installation_ to run.  Just **unzip, and run** either the 64-bit version, or the 32-bit version depending on which platform you're on.  It can save the settings to the extracted folder and run entirely portable.

## MSI Installer

For those who prefer to have JPEGView installed for All Users, a 32-bit/64-bit installer will be available to download starting with v1.0.40.  I don't own a code signing certificate yet, so the MSI release is not signed.

### WinGet

If you're on Windows 11, or Windows 10 (build 1709 or later), you can also download it directly from the official [Microsoft WinGet tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/) repository.  This downloads the latest MSI installer directly from GitHub for installation.

Example Usage:

C:\> `winget search jpegview`
```
Name     Id              Version  Source
-----------------------------------------
JPEGView sylikc.JPEGView 1.0.39.1 winget
```

C:\> `winget install jpegview`
```

## PortableApps

Another option is to use the official [JPEGView on PortableApps](https://portableapps.com/apps/graphics_pictures/jpegview_portable) package.  The PortableApps launcher preserves user settings in a separate directory from the extracted application directory.  This release is signed.

## System Requirements

32-bit version: Windows XP SP2 or later

64-bit version: Windows 7/8/10/11 64-bit or later

# Brief History

This GitHub repo continues the legacy (is a "fork") of the excellent project [JPEGView by David Kleiner](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jpegview/).  Unfortunately, starting in 2020, the SourceForge project has essentially been abandoned, with the last update being [2018-02-24 (1.0.37)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jpegview/files/jpegview/).  It's an excellent lightweight image viewer that I use almost daily!

The starting point for this repo was a direct clone from SourceForge SVN to GitHub Git.  By continuing this way, it retains all previous commits and all original author comments.  

I'm hoping with this project, some devs might help me keep the project alive!  It's been awhile, and could use some new features or updates.  Looking forward to the community making suggestions, and devs will help with some do pull requests as some of the image code is quite a learning curve for me to pick it up. -sylikc
