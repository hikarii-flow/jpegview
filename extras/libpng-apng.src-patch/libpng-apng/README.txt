This modified version of libpng code adds animated PNG support and is
released under the same license as the upstream library. The modifications
are Copyright (c) 2006-2007 Andrew Smith, Copyright (c) 2008-2017 Max Stepin,
and are delimited by "#ifdef PNG_APNG_SUPPORTED / #endif" directives
surrounding them in the modified libpng source files.
